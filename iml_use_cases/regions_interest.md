Here is a list of the regions/features/lines in the optical range from 350 nm to 750 nm where physical information about a galaxy can be obtained, along with their corresponding wavelengths:

* **Hydrogen Balmer series:** The hydrogen Balmer series consists of a series of emission or absorption lines in the spectra of hydrogen atoms, caused by transitions between energy levels in the hydrogen atom. The wavelengths of the lines in the series are given by the Balmer formula:$Î» = 364.6 / (n^2) nm$, where n is an integer greater than 2. The most prominent lines in the series are the H-alpha line at 656.3 nm, the H-beta line at 486.1 nm, and the H-gamma line at 434.0 nm. These lines are commonly used to measure the physical properties of hydrogen gas, such as its temperature and density.

* **Oxygen forbidden lines:** The oxygen forbidden lines are emission lines in the spectra of oxygen atoms that are caused by transitions between energy levels in the atom that are forbidden by the laws of quantum mechanics. These lines are typically very weak and are only observed in regions of high-excitation, such as in the nebulae surrounding young, hot stars. The most prominent oxygen forbidden lines are the [O III] doublet at 500.7 nm and 495.9 nm, which is often used to measure the physical properties of ionized oxygen gas, such as its temperature and density.

* **Calcium H and K lines:** The calcium H and K lines are absorption lines in the spectra of calcium atoms, caused by transitions between energy levels in the atom. These lines are commonly used to measure the physical properties of calcium in stars and galaxies, such as its abundance and temperature. The wavelengths of the H and K lines are 393.4 nm and 396.8 nm, respectively.

* **Iron lines:** Iron lines are absorption lines in the spectra of iron atoms, caused by transitions between energy levels in the atom. These lines are commonly used to measure the physical properties of iron in stars and galaxies, such as its abundance and temperature. Some of the most prominent iron lines in the optical range are the Fe I lines at 427.8 nm and 438.4 nm, and the Fe II lines at 501.1 nm and 558.4 nm.

* **Nitrogen lines:** Nitrogen lines are emission or absorption lines in the spectra of nitrogen atoms, caused by transitions between energy levels in the atom. These lines are commonly used to measure the physical properties of nitrogen in stars and galaxies, such as its abundance and temperature. Some of the most prominent nitrogen lines in the optical range are the [N II] lines at 654.8 nm and 658.3 nm, and the [N III] lines at 465.9 nm and 495.9 nm.

* **Carbon lines:** Carbon lines are emission or absorption lines in the spectra of carbon atoms, caused by transitions between energy levels in the atom. These lines are commonly used to measure the physical properties of carbon in stars and galaxies, such as its abundance and temperature. Some of the most prominent carbon lines in the optical range are the [C II] lines at 370.4 nm and 658.3 nm, and the [C III] lines at 465.9 nm and 495.9 nm.
