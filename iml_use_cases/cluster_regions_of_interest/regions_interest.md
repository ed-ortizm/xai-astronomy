Here is a list of the regions/features/lines in the optical range from 350 nm to 750 nm where physical information about a galaxy can be obtained, along with their corresponding wavelengths:

* **Hydrogen Balmer series:** The hydrogen Balmer series consists of a series of emission or absorption lines in the spectra of hydrogen atoms, caused by transitions between energy levels in the hydrogen atom. The wavelengths of the lines in the series are given by the Balmer formula:$Î» = 364.6 / (n^2) nm$, where n is an integer greater than 2. The most prominent lines in the series are the H-alpha line at 656.3 nm, the H-beta line at 486.1 nm, and the H-gamma line at 434.0 nm. These lines are commonly used to measure the physical properties of hydrogen gas, such as its temperature and density.

* **Oxygen forbidden lines:** The oxygen forbidden lines are emission lines in the spectra of oxygen atoms that are caused by transitions between energy levels in the atom that are forbidden by the laws of quantum mechanics. These lines are typically very weak and are only observed in regions of high-excitation, such as in the nebulae surrounding young, hot stars. The most prominent oxygen forbidden lines are the [O III] doublet at 500.7 nm and 495.9 nm, which is often used to measure the physical properties of ionized oxygen gas, such as its temperature and density.

* **Calcium H and K lines:** The calcium H and K lines are absorption lines in the spectra of calcium atoms, caused by transitions between energy levels in the atom. These lines are commonly used to measure the physical properties of calcium in stars and galaxies, such as its abundance and temperature. The wavelengths of the H and K lines are 393.4 nm and 396.8 nm, respectively.

* **Iron lines:** Iron lines are absorption lines in the spectra of iron atoms, caused by transitions between energy levels in the atom. These lines are commonly used to measure the physical properties of iron in stars and galaxies, such as its abundance and temperature. Some of the most prominent iron lines in the optical range are the Fe I lines at 427.8 nm and 438.4 nm, and the Fe II lines at 501.1 nm and 558.4 nm.

* **Nitrogen lines:** Nitrogen lines are emission or absorption lines in the spectra of nitrogen atoms, caused by transitions between energy levels in the atom. These lines are commonly used to measure the physical properties of nitrogen in stars and galaxies, such as its abundance and temperature. Some of the most prominent nitrogen lines in the optical range are the [N II] lines at 654.8 nm and 658.3 nm, and the [N III] lines at 465.9 nm and 495.9 nm.

* **Carbon lines:** Carbon lines are emission or absorption lines in the spectra of carbon atoms, caused by transitions between energy levels in the atom. These lines are commonly used to measure the physical properties of carbon in stars and galaxies, such as its abundance and temperature. Some of the most prominent carbon lines in the optical range are the [C II] lines at 370.4 nm and 658.3 nm, and the [C III] lines at 465.9 nm and 495.9 nm.

* **H $\alpha$ + [NII] doublet:** 
    * **H $\alpha$:** This line is often used to study the ionized gas in galaxies, as the strength and width of the line can provide information about the temperature and density of the gas, as well as the presence of shocks or outflows.
    * **[NII] doublet:** These lines are often used to study the metallicity (abundance of elements heavier than helium) and ionization state of the gas in galaxies. The ratio of the two lines can provide information about the physical conditions in the gas, such as the temperature, density, and radiation field.
    * **Line ratios:** In general, the ratio between the strength of the two lines in the [NII] doublet (6548 and 6584 Angstrom) to the strength of the H-alpha line (6563 Angstrom) can be used to differentiate between different types of objects, such as H II regions, active galactic nuclei (AGN), and LINERs. H II regions typically have a high ratio of [NII]/H-alpha, while AGN and LINERs both have lower ratios. This is because the [NII] doublet and H-alpha lines are often produced by different physical processes, and the relative strength of these lines can provide insight into the dominant source of ionization in the object. For example, H II regions are ionized by hot, young stars, and the [NII] doublet is produced by collisional excitation of nitrogen atoms by fast electrons. The H-alpha line is produced by recombination of hydrogen atoms. In AGN and LINERs, the [NII] doublet and H-alpha lines are often produced by photoionization by a central source of radiation, such as a supermassive black hole. The relative strength of these lines can therefore be used to distinguish between these different types of objects and to understand the physical processes at work in them.

<!-- ## Analyze clusters among anomalies
The clustering approach can help to gain insight into the model by grouping the anomalous spectra into clusters based on their similarity in terms of the weights assigned by the LIME algorithm. This can help identify patterns or trends in the explanations that may not be immediately apparent from the weights alone.

For example, certain clusters might have higher explanation weights for certain wavelength ranges, or certain clusters have higher explanation weights overall. This can help to understand which features of the spectra are most important for the model's predictions, and can potentially uncover new scientific insights.

Additionally, by plotting the mean spectrum and mean explanation weights for each cluster, I can get a sense of how the model is using different features of the spectra to make its predictions, and identify any patterns or trends in the model's behavior that may be relevant to the anomaly detection task. -->
